How To Make A Fresh Redlinux (server) Install: (32 or 64 bits)

1. Install the latest version of Archlinux whether 32 or 64 bits.
2. Login as root and run the following commands:
wget http://redlinernotes.com/docs/server/pkglist.txt
pacman -S `cat pkglist.txt`
3. Add new user, enable wheel group in sudoers. Login as new user.
4. Extract and insert default config files:
wget http://redlinernotes.com/docs/server/configs.tar.gz
tar -zxvf configs.tar.gz
mv configs/* ~/
mv configs/.[^.]* ~/
sudo mv etc/* /etc/*
sudo mv etc/lighttpd/* /etc/lighttpd/
rm -R etc/
rm -R configs/
rm configs.tar.gz
Then add postgresql and lighttpd to the daemons array in rc.conf.
You'll also want to run sudo /etc/rc.d/postgresql start, then su root,
su - postgres, createuser -DRSP username, and createdb -O dbname as necessary.
For lighttpd, ensure a http user and group exist with groupadd and useradd.
Then ensure /var/log/lighttpd is owned and /srv/http is owned by http:http.
Transfer over any private keys and you're good.
## There still may be stuff missing from these configs.
## i.e. scripts/* or forgotten stuff in /etc or elsewhere...
## 5. Keep installing clbuild for now. It's nice for personal projects. mkdir ~/builds && cd ~/builds && darcs get http://common-lisp.net/project/clbuild/clbuild
5. "curl -O http://beta.quicklisp.org/quicklisp.lisp" then run "sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp" and follow the instructions to get quicklisp installed. Finally, run (ql:quickload "quicklisp-slime-helper").
6. mkdir -p ~/builds/paktahn and cd into it. Then wget the pkgbuild and supporting files for paktahn and run makepkg -s. Build it and pacman -U paktahn*.pkg.*
7. Add .paktahn/config.lisp with "(in-package :pak) (setf *color-scheme* *color-scheme-lightbg*)".
8. Run the following commands:
cd ~
wget http://redlinernotes.com/docs/server/aurlist.txt
paktahn -S `cat aurlist.txt`
9. DONE!
