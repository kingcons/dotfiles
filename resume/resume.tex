\begin{position}
  I worked on numerous products using Ruby/Rails and C. I added allocation
  tracking machinery to a modern 20k SLOC C project to aid in finding memory
  leaks and reducing the overall memory footprint. I took over maintenance of
  a legacy product, Mix, migrating from Ruby 1.8.7 to 1.9.3 and orchestrating
  numerous point releases. I also contributed substantial work to the primary
  product, Patterns, including the report download builders, keeping report
  attributes in SQL shards, overhauling the permissions system, and the usual
  bugfixes and minor features.
