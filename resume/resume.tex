  I taught immersive, full-time courses in Backend Engineering using Ruby/Rails.
  I was promoted to Lead Instructor after 6 months. As an instructor, I iterated
  on curriculum, lectured, graded assignments, and worked 1-on-1 with students

  I worked on several data analysis products written in Ruby/Rails and C.
  I added allocation tracking machinery to a modern 20k SLOC C project to aid
  in finding memory leaks and reducing the overall memory footprint. I took
  over maintenance of a legacy product, Mix, migrating from Ruby 1.8.7 to 1.9.3
  and overseeing numerous point releases. I also contributed substantial work
  to the primary product, Patterns, including the report download builders and
  storing report attributes in SQL shards.

  TV, and Radio publishers. I had particular focuses on admin
  customization and data migration. I oversaw the migration of over
  100K users from multiple markets to our new CMS.
  I made broad improvements to our Brightcove video import
  scripts using celery and memcached. I also gave talks on
  \href{http://redlinernotes.com/docs/talks/opa.html}{``Programmer
    Archaeology''} and
  \href{http://redlinernotes.com/docs/talks/wosw.html}{the Economics

\section{Interests}

When I'm not in front of my computer, I like to make cocktails, spend
time with my partner and our goofy dogs, play Smash Brothers Melee,
and noodle on a modular synth. I also try to blog and reflect at
\url{http://blog.kingcons.io/}.

I have serious interests in Intellectual Property Law and Peer Production.
As far as Comp Sci topics, I am fascinated by the implementation of dynamic,
reflective languages such as Lisp and Smalltalk and the careful interplay
between adaptive optimizations and the language runtime to make them fast.
